# Gambling simulation

This project is meant to simulate a simple game between a gambler and a croupier.

### Rules of the game
Let's consider an unusual roulette, like the one below:
<p align="center"><img src="https://debitcardcasino.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/100-to-1-roulette-table.jpg" width="350" height="200"> </p>

- The gambler and the croupier agree the amount of money to bet
- The croupier throws the ball, so that a number from 1 to 100 will be randomly selected
- Who wins the money?
  - The gambler if the number is >= 52;
  - The croupier otherwise;

The game is obviously **unfair**: the winning percentage is 49% for the gambler and 51% for the croupier! 

**Many people would take the risk once to try their luck, but what happens if they keep on playing?**

The aim of my little simulation is to show the correlation between the number of bets played and the expected loss for the gambler. The idea behind my project is to prove that "the more he plays, the more he loses" or, in other words, that ***"The house always wins!"***
