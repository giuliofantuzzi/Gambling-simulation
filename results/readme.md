# Results
With an initial amount of 10000$ and a bet amount of 100$ my simulation gave the following results:

|N. OF BETS| EXPECTED FINAL AMOUNT ($)| EXPECTED LOSS ($)|
|---|---|---|
|1|10000|0|
|5|9980|20|
|10|9964|36|
|25|9934|66|
|50|9880|120|
|100|9829|171|
|200|9700|300|
|500|9046|954|
|1000|7943|2057|

These numbers can confirm the initial hypotesis. The fact that a gambler would try his luck with one single bet can be justified by a loss expectancy of 0$, but the table above clearly shows that by increasing the number of bets, the expected loss increases too.
